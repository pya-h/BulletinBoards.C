<h1>Bulletin Boards Project</h1>
<h3>Language: Old School C :)</h3>

<p>This is a College Computer Major Project. I've coded this single project for 3 different person.</p>
<p>The actual purpose was that variations must be in a way, that no one find out they are all done by one person [me!].</p>
<p> So they are coded in 3 different separate variations, with 3 different styles, with 3 different approaches and algorithms,
with 3 different naming conventions, 3 different header structures, and etc.<p>

<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>There are 3 different variations that are explaied as below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>1st and Main Variation:
      <p>This one is my own style; This is me being me while doing a project!</p>
    </li>
    <li>2nd Variation: A MidLevel C Programmer:
      <p>This one is me imitating a medium level programmer! So i had considered some intentional programming weaknesses while coding.</p>
    </li>
    <li>3rd And Last one: Me imitating an ameteur programmer!
      <p>I have coded this one in a way that indicates a amateur programming method as a newbie programmer :)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
